**A Multimodal Approach for Predicting lncRNA-Disease Associations Using CapsNet and Chaos Game Representation**

It is necessary to accurately predict the relationships between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and human diseases to study the molecular processes and create specific therapies. This paper proposes a new hybrid deep learning model incorporating state-of-the-art models like Chaos Game Representation, Capsule Networks, and Graph Neural Networks in predicting lncRNA-disease associations. The main innovation of our model is that CGR transforms lncRNA sequences into 2D images without losing any spatial features (pad, truncation). The method can solve the issue of long sequence processing, allowing the model to extract more detailed information about raw biological data. In contrast to earlier methods that relied on prior similarities, our end-to-end method computes relationships directly from raw data, which means that the model will learn the most accurate and relevant features. It goes a long way to increase prediction accuracy and extrapolate better to unknown data. Moreover, CGR images maintain spatial hierarchies with the help of CapsNet.
In contrast, GNNs model more complex interactions between genes and diseases, which the model can identify, and other algorithms tend to overlook. To further enhance the results, the CBAM is also added to concentrate on the most important features of the data. Five-fold cross-validation and independent testing were used to test the model strictly. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the current methods with a mean AUC of 0.9444 and AUPR of 0.9469. On an independent test set, the AUC was 95.21 percent, and the AUPR was 95.42 percent, which is very high in generalization despite imbalanced data. This model has tremendous potential in biomedical research, precision medicine, and new biological marker and therapeutic target discovery, and has been described as a platform for scalable and interpretable future studies.
