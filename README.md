A Multimodal Approach for Predicting lncRNA-Disease Associations Using CapsNet and Chaos Game Representation

This repository contains the code and dataset for predicting long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-disease associations using a novel deep learning approach based on Capsule Networks (CapsNet) and Chaos Game Representation (CGR) images. The model integrates multimodal data sources, including lncRNA sequence images (via CGR) and gene-disease association vectors, to predict potential relationships between lncRNAs and diseases.

LncRNA plays a significant role in many biological processes and diseases. In this project, we propose a new deep learning approach for lncRNA-disease association prediction. Our approach uses a multi-branch architecture where the CapsNet branch learns spatial features from CGR images of lncRNA sequences, while the MLP branch processes symbolic gene-disease association data. The attention-based fusion mechanism allows for dynamic importance weighting of both modalities, resulting in improved prediction accuracy.
